==================

The first photo of Earth from space was taken on October 24, 1946, from an altitude of 65 miles above the surface of New Mexico. It was captured by a 35-millimeter motion picture camera as that camera was propelled skyward on a German V-2 missile. 

However, most people recall of the iconic Blue Marble - a famous photograph of the Earth, taken on December 7, 1972, by the crew of the Apollo 17 spacecraft, at a distance of about 45,000 kilometres (28,000 mi).

Since spaceflight began, millions of photos have been taken of Earth from space, many of these images are never seen by a wider audience.
